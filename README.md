# Run instructions:

Start the program, it will ask you how big the board should be, horizontally and vertically, and then print that out.

# Question Asked to AI( Claude.ai ): 

What do you think I can improve with this solution of printing a chessboard?

I got alot of suggestions, pretty much all of them made the project get out of scope of the assignment, so I decided to ignore it and ask a friend who works with C# What he would improve, I documented in Program.cs what he suggested
